# About

This is custom firmware based on ESPHome, which allows you to remote control certain Intex
pool filtration pumps and saltwater chlorinators with an ESP32 microcontroller, which
can be added as a modification to these devices. You can then remotely power toggle the
devices by any means supported by ESPHome, most notably the Home Assistant home automation
platform.

You can use the buttons below to install the pre-built firmware directly to your device via USB from the browser.
