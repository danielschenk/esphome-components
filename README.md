# My components for ESPHome

This repository contains components for [ESPHome](https://esphome.io), which is firmware
for microcontrollers which enables all kinds of devices to be connected to Home Assistant
to automate them.

At this point it only contains components which are still a work in progress, for my pool
automation project. If you want to more know about this, you can read
[my series of blog posts about it](https://www.danielschenk.tech/swimming-pool/hacking-pool-1).
